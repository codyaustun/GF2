Shit To Do (STD):
- Define a semantic rule for max clock option
- modify EBNF to reflect changes to device rule
- modify EBNF to reflect removal of option monitor names
- modify EBNF to reflect the fact that not all signals are in the form name.signal
-- change connection rule
-- change monitor rule



Parser changes
- new device type: RC
-- option: number of cycles until the output falls low
-- 1 output
-- no inputs

- new checks
-- in sigcheck
-- in option check
-- in monitor and connection
--- check for output


Scanner changes:
- Add RC to names table (element 34)

Semantics
- RC is a reserved word
